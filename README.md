Hello World!

My name is Leonardo Calderaro Teixeira, I am a studying software development in a college here in Brazil. This is a project dedicated to my personal studies. My intent here is to make a repository of many different applications that I will make while studying. I will differentiate which ones I created from the ground up from the ones I followed a tutorial.

In the future, I intend to be a full stack developer and specialize in neural networks. For now, I am focusing in web development. I will at first study Git, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js and Nest.js. Latter on, I intend to study even more technologies in this stack.
